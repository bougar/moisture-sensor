# ðŸª´ Arduino Smart Plant Monitor (Wi-Fi Enabled)

## Project Description

This repository hosts the code and documentation for a **Smart Plant Monitoring System** built using an Arduino microcontroller.

The project utilizes a **soil moisture sensor** to continuously track the hydration level of a plant's soil. Real-time data is displayed locally on an **LCD/OLED screen** and can be transmitted via a **Wi-Fi module (ESP8266)** (Not supported yet).

This system transforms basic sensor readings into actionable, remote data for optimal plant care.
